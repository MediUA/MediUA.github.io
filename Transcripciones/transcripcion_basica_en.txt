Hello everyone.

Today we’re going to talk about diabetes, a disease you’ve probably heard mentioned many times. It affects more than 400 million people worldwide, and it’s important to understand what it is and how we can prevent it.

Diabetes is a disease in which our body can’t properly use the sugar we eat. Imagine that sugar is like fuel for our cells. We need a key called insulin to let that fuel in. In people with diabetes, that key doesn’t work well or doesn’t exist, so the sugar stays circulating in the blood, which is dangerous for our health.

In addition, a large percentage of the population is unaware that they have this disease, as shown in the chart.

There are two main types. Type 1 diabetes usually appears in children and young people and occurs when the body doesn’t produce insulin. Type 2, the most common, appears when the body doesn’t use the insulin it produces well. The most common symptoms are: feeling very thirsty all the time, urinating very frequently, feeling very tired without an apparent reason, and having blurry vision.

Here comes the good news.
Type 2 diabetes, which is the most common, can be prevented. How? With three simple things: eating healthily—especially fruits, vegetables, and whole foods; exercising at least 30 minutes a day, such as walking or dancing; and maintaining a healthy weight. If you already have diabetes, don’t worry: with medication, medical monitoring, and these same habits, you can live perfectly well.

Remember: taking care of your health is in your hands. Information is power, and now you know the basics about diabetes. Thank you very much for your attention.
