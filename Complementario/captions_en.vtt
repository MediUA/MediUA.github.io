Hello everyone. Today we're going to talk about
diabetes, a disease that

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.230
you've probably heard mentioned
many times. It affects more than 400

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.310
million people in the world and it's
important to understand what it is

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.550
and how we can prevent it.
Diabetes is a disease in which our

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.310
body cannot properly use the sugar
we eat. Imagine that sugar is like

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.349
fuel for our cells.
We need a key called insulin

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.349
for that fuel to enter. In people
with diabetes, that key doesn't

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.590
work properly or doesn't exist. So the
sugar stays circulating in the blood,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.950
which is dangerous for our health.
Additionally, a large percentage of the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.430
population doesn't know they have
this disease, as shown in the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.549
chart.
There are two main types.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.709
Type 1 diabetes generally appears in
children and young people and occurs when

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.869
the body doesn't produce insulin. Type 2,
which is the most common, appears when the

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.310
body doesn't use the insulin it produces
properly.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.549
The most common symptoms are feeling
very thirsty all the time, going to the bathroom

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.750
very frequently, feeling very tired
for no apparent reason and having

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.950
blurred vision.
Here comes the good news. Type

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.350
2 diabetes, which is the most common, can be
prevented. How? With three simple things.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.510
Eating healthy, especially fruits, vegetables
and whole foods. Exercising

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.069
at least 30 minutes a
day, like walking or dancing, and maintaining

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.950
a healthy weight. If you already have
diabetes, don't worry. With medication,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.749
medical monitoring and these same
habits, you can live

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.149
perfectly well. Remember, taking care
of your health is in your hands.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.230
Information is power. And now you know the
basics about diabetes. Thank you very much

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.560
for your attention.
